The tasks you need to complete are the following:

  1. Create a local database or storage with the entities needed to store the brands and clothing types
  2. Build an algorithm that detects in any word typed by the user which part of the word have a Brand and a Clothing Type.
  3. Create a user interface with a search field and a submit button to make the search, that calls the algorithm described in the step 2.
  4. Display in a new screen a table with the sections and results depending of the results of the algorithm built in the step 2.

Important Notes:
  * The algorithm should find a brand or a clothing type, no matter the order of the words written.
  * The algorithm should find the brand or clothing type with more relevance in reference to  the word typed.
  * The user can type anything. So if the algorithm matches only a brand or a clothing type should present only the sections that apply. If the algorithm doesn't match anything, should present only the section "Result Query" with the whole word.
